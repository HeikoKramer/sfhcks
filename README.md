# Salesforce H@cks
This repo is a lose collection of Salesforce stuff I find useful enough to keep. <br>
Likely it will mostly contain anonymous Apex scripts, but let's see where this is going. <br> 
I have an other Salesforce related repo for the [command line stuff](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/sfdx) <br>

## ON / OFF Switches
The purpose for my [on-/off switch scripts](https://github.com/HeikoKramer/sfhcks/tree/master/OnOffSwitches) was a data load intense full sandbox replacement project I have participated in. <br> 
The last things you need when loading a production backup into a partial sandbox via multiple etl jobs are validations and triggers. <br>
My scripts saved me from deactivating all that stuff manually, keep note of what was active, and manual activation after the load. <br>
The below shown method works with **validation rules**, **process builder** and **workflow rules**. <br>
It could probably quickly be adopted for **flows**, but wont unfortunately work with *Apex triggers*. <br> 
<br>
**Method:** <br>
* STEP1: Query vr, pb or wfr via **tooling api** -> store their metadedata in cases. <br>
* STEP2: Loop through those cases, switch active elements off via **tooling api**. <br>
* STEP3: Loop again through those cases, switch prior activated elements back on via **tooling api**. <br>

Each STEP is marked in the script. Execute them one-by-one. <br>
**NOTE:** You could run into troubles if you've active trigger, routing or validation logic set on the case object. <br>
If you have a lot of rules in your org you might hit api call limits. <br>

Quick way to get table format  >> it will send you those values tagged as html table.  
Copy mail body into texteditor >> save as .html file >> open in browser  
Then copy it into Excel or wherever you need it.

Had to find all Email Alerts which where sending mails to a certain public group.

Just specify your recipient in line 23 and fire >> results in the debug log
